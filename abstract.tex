TO BE DONE

%In the last few years, we have experienced a rush of online storage services with
%a complete set of tools for file syncing, sharing and collaboration.
%Unfortunately, commercial Personal Cloud solutions, e.g. Dropbox, Box, SkyDrive and the likes, are
%closed and proprietary, which supposes a serious impediment to progress research, also forcing
%people to be stranded into locked systems. In this context, we
%argue about the necessity for an open-source Personal Cloud framework that provides scalable file synchronization
%and sharing, and that allows anyone to easily	implement and evaluate new ideas.
%This framework, called StackSync, is modular and extensible, and contains all the software pieces to run
%a basic Personal Cloud, namely support for metadata management, efficient notification, deduplication, and data
%storage, among others. Our reference implementation in Java is a push-based architecture built around an asynchronous 
%high-performance message broker (RabbitMQ). We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using
%our standard benchmarking test suite.

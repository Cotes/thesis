\section{Conclusions}
In this thesis, we have examined central aspects of Personal Cloud storages 
services to characterize their performance in two different ways, data transfers
and synchronization protocol.

First of all, we present a measurement study of various Personal Clouds: Dropbox, Box and SugarSync.
From this work we conclude:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The transfer performance of these services 
	\textit{greatly varies from one provider to another}, which is a valuable 
	piece of information for designers and developers.
	
	\item The \textit{geographic location} of a client importantly impacts on
	the speed of transfers. For instance, North American clients experience 
	transfers several times faster than European ones for the same Personal Cloud. 
	
	\item The \textit{variability} of transfers depends on several
	factors, such as the \textit{traffic type (in/out) or the hour of the day}.
	Actually, we found daily patterns in the DropBox service.

\end{itemize}

After the measurement, we study the sync protocol of StackSync, our open source Personal Cloud,
and other private solutions. To perform this tests we developed a novel trace generated
that could be useful for other researchers to simulate user behaviour. We have also extended
a benchmarking tool to achieve realistic tests with our generated traces.

As a result of these experiments, we can conclude that StackSync is going in the right
way as a Personal Cloud. In the comparison with other private solutions, we have demonstrated that,
in terms of overhead, we have done a good work.
